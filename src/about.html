        Hi, thank you for stopping by my page! My name is Bhavna Achar and Iâ€™m a first year computer
        programming student at Seneca College in Toronto, Canada, graduating in April 2023. This is
        my first web page that I have created, using plain HTML and CSS. My favourite thing about
        this field is that anyone sitting in any part of the world with a laptop and an eagerness to
        learn, can create interactive applications that can not only be fun, but can also change the
        world in a positive way. For this project, I chose to shed light on elephants because I have
        personally had an affinity towards these gentle giants since I was a little child. I am
        fascinated by how huge and majestic they are while also being extremely intelligent and
        compassionate. I hope this web page can give you a little insight on what these creatures
        are and how they live. I hope to one day be a proficient full stack engineer that can
        contribute and give back to society. Until then, I will keep learning and creating more fun
        content. See you next time :)
